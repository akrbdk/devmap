## Just a few tips:

---

Используйте `bullet point approach`, когда готовитесь к собеседованию. Вместо того, чтобы записывать и заучивать целые
предложения,
выделите основные тезисные пункты и потренируйте свой ответ в разговоре с другом или просто перед зеркалом. Ваша цель —
звучать
легко и естественно.

---

Не избегайте `small talk`. Покажите, что вы умеете поддерживать непринужденный разговор на различные темы. Будьте готовы
поговорить о том, чем вы занимаетесь помимо работы, ваших любимых книгах, хобби и т. д. Будьте приветливы и на вопрос „How are you?”
отвечайте: „I’m great/very well/doing good. What about yourself?”, а не „Normal” (что, по сути, неправильно) или „Not bad.”

---

Вас могут попросить рассказать о каких-либо трудностях, с которыми вам пришлось столкнуться. В случаях, когда нужно
рассказать такую историю из личного опыта, можно применять „STAR technique”. STAR значит:

- `Situation` — опишите конкретную ситуацию или проблему.
- `Task` — задача, которая перед вами стояла.
- `Action` — что вы сделали, чтобы выполнить эту задачу и решить проблему.
- `Result` — каков был конечный результат.

---

Поблагодарите интервьюера, отправив `follow-up` имейл после собеседования. Это поможет вам выделиться из толпы
кандидатов и заодно покажет, что вы знакомы с англоязычной культурой общения.

---

главный показатель вашего уровня на собеседовании — это, во-первых, то, что `вы говорите, а не из вас вытягивают слова`.
Во-вторых, связная речь без запинок, заикания и пауз. Следите за темпом речи. Лучше говорить более медленно, но размеренно, чем быстро и сбивчиво.

---

`Старайтесь давать развернутые ответы`, ведь если вы отвечаете на все вопросы односложно, ваш уровень никак не смогут
оценить. Никто не поймет, upper вы или inter, если каждый ваш ответ — это одно слово.

---

Практикуйте `active listening` — слушайте собеседника и реагируйте на его комментарии. Таким образом вы покажете не
только заинтересованность в беседе, но и то, что вы в курсе, как общаются носители языка. То есть никто никогда не припишет вам
Pre-Intermediate, даже если вы сказали will после if :)

---

„Повысить” свой уровень в ускоренном режиме и без особых усилий можно с помощью некоторых общих фраз, которые часто
используют носители языка (но мы часто игнорируем). Например:

![](images/image1_6CuSF8k.png)

---

Кроме этого, разнообразить свой словарный запас и создать впечатление беглого английского помогают слова, заменяющие выражения с „very”:

	- Very good = amazing, awesome, fantastic, top-notch
	- Very bad = awful, terrible, lame (informal)
	- Very interesting = fascinating
	- Very boring = dull
	- Like very much = love
	- Very big = huge
	- Very small = tiny
	- Very important = crucial, critical, key

И еще помогают так называемые „filler words”, то есть слова, которые ничего, по большому счету, не значат, но делают
речь более плавной и выигрывают вам дополнительное время подумать над вопросом. Например:

	- I would say that...
	- Let me see...
	- You know...
	- I mean...
	- It’s hard to remember off the top of my head...

---

В плане грамматики лучше сконцентрироваться на основах и не забивать голову новыми правилами за день до собеседования.
Из основ вам больше всего понадобятся:

- `Past Simple` — о прошлых проектах, предыдущих местах работы, первых шагах и т. д. Всегда используется, когда ваше
  предложение отвечает на вопрос: „Когда именно в прошлом?” e.g. I designed my first app when I was in university.
- `Present Perfect` — о результатах на данный момент e.g. „I’ve worked at my current company for 6 years”.
- `Going to` — для планов на будущее e.g. „I’m going to take a PMI exam this spring”.
- `Present Simple` — для тех действий, которые происходят с какой-то частотой в настоящем e.g. „I very rarely travel
  abroad”.
- Также такие темы, как `Gerunds` and `Infinitives`, `First` and `Second Conditionals` и `Prepositions`.

---

`Secret grammar tip`: практически всегда вас спросят: „How long have you been working as ...?” И тут многие проваливают
тест на английский, потому что отвечают не в том времени: „I work/I’m working as a developer for 5 year”. This is wrong! В
английском все просто: `в каком времени вопрос, в таком времени ответ` (зачастую). Плюс у вас есть маркер времени for, поэтому если вы
не используете время Present Perfect Continuous, как было в вопросе, ваш уровень для собеседника едва дотянет до weak Intermediate.

---

Произношению нужно также определить особое внимание. Проверьте свое произношение самых часто используемых вами слов (
например, в Google dictionary). Можно начать с этого списка:

![](images/image2_UE44ucJ.png)

---

`Practice makes perfect!` Всегда репетируйте перед собеседованием. Да, как в фильмах американцы стоят в ванной перед
зеркалом и повторяют свою речь. Но не заучивайте ничего, вы должны говорить максимально непринужденно и естественно.

---

### Структура собеседования

- Small Talk - Приветствие
- Intro — вступление настроит слушателя на восприятие информации и сформирует ожидания от последующей речи;
- Main part — основной раздел даст информацию об экспертизе и опыте;
- Human touch — лёгкая непринуждённость и живое участие в диалоге помогут разбавить сухие технические детали;
- Closure: signalizing the end of the self-pitch by inviting questions from the interviewer — завершение и «передача микрофона» поможет проявить внимание и уважение к собеседнику, предоставит ему возможность занять активную позицию в беседе.

### ЭТАПЫ ИНТЕРВЬЮ

- СКРИНИНГ С HR
- ТЕХНИЧЕСКОЕ ИНТЕРВЬЮ
- ИНТЕРВЬЮ С OWNER

---

### Читаем вакансию и отбираем релевантные навыки
- В первую очередь изучите вакансию и выделите опорные точки для вашей будущей речи.
- Сравните свою экспертизу и опыт с ожиданиями работодателя и выберите релевантные примеры для питча. 
- Отметьте, где ваших опыта и экспертизы не хватает, в каких моментах ожидания компании могут не оправдаться. Продумайте, как это можно смягчить, оставшись при этом честным и не создав от себя завышенных и неадекватных ожиданий.

Например это:
- стратегическое мышление (“... and think ahead”), 
- навыки кросс-функционального взаимодействия (“Collaborate with front-end developers, QA engineers, analysts, devops engineers”), 
- навыки предоставления обратной связи (“Conduct code review”), 
- проактивность, навыки решения проблем и ведения дискуссий (“Participate in the improvement of development processes”). 
- бережная и уважительная коммуникация и прозрачность в межкомандном взаимодействии (“...in an Agile environment”).

---

### Правильно рассказываем о слабых сторонах

    Sorry, I don’t have enough experience with Kubernetes.

Вы рискуете тем, что фраза запомнится прямотой и безапелляционностью, затмит ваши сильные стороны и существенно повлияет на решение рекрутера. 
Чтобы этого не произошло, попробуйте избегать отрицательных конструкций.

    I wish I had more experience and expertise related to Kubernetes.

На русском звучит не очень естественно — мы так мысли не выражаем, но приблизительно так в сознании англоговорящего отразится это предложение. 
Конструкция I wish I had smth… честно, но мягко расскажет об отсутствии чего-то в настоящий момент.

Ещё убедительнее — добавить информацию о том, что вы владеете другой родственной технологией (языком, фреймворком), которая может вам пригодиться в освоении требуемого навыка.

    I wish I had more experience and expertise related to Kubernetes. However, 
    I have experience working with cloud native tools and I’m pretty good at using Go. 
    
    Kubernetes is written in it, so I believe I can make it out quite efficiently.
    My knowledge and hands-on experience with SpringBoot will be helpful as well.

Получается длинновато, но в английском всегда так: чем вежливее надо звучать или чем щекотливее предмет разговора, тем длиннее и витиеватее становятся фразы.

В английском языке и международном сообществе не жалуют прямолинейность — обычно предпочитают смягчать и «притушать» резкие высказывания дополнительными оборотами.

Если трюк с родственными технологиями невозможен, попробуйте компенсировать отсутствие того или иного навыка высокой обучаемостью.

    I wish I had more experience and expertise related to Docker, and I’m ready to invest time 
    and effort in grasping it as quickly as possible. In my previous project, I had to apply frameworks 
    that were absolutely new to me, and I was able to learn on the fly. 

Таким образом вы всегда компенсируете недостающие навыки позитивным фактом: знанием родственных технологий или готовностью быстро осваивать новое.

---

### «I don’t know»?

- I’ve never done it, but I’m a quick learner.
- Here’s what I know… and here’s what I don’t know…
- I haven’t dealt with a situation like that before, but I would start by asking these questions…
- I see this job as an opportunity to learn more about this topic.


### Добавляем человечности и непринуждённости

Скорее всего, в вас ищут человека и коллегу, а не просто машину для генерации кода. Чтобы показать себя с более непринуждённой стороны, добавьте своей презентации human touch — чего-то тёплого и человеческого. Расскажите о своих интересах и увлечениях в свободное от работы время. 

Любовь к кофе объединяет и роднит почти всех из мира IT :) 

    I’m a massive fan of coffee and I never miss a chance to discuss the latest robotics trends over a cup of espresso.

### Используйте слова вроде please (пожалуйста), could you (не могли бы вы) и thank you (спасибо). 

### Слова и фразы вроде you know (знаете) и well (ну) заполняют паузы в речи и дают пару секунд, чтобы подумать над ответом или построить фразу.

## НАПРИМЕР:

Intro

	Hello! My name is Alex. Let me tell you a couple of words about myself. 
 	I’ve been a PHP developer for seven years. I’m going to walk you through those of
  	my skills that I feel could make me a good fit for the position.

Main part

	I’ve got experience developing and maintaining PHP services. One of my main responsibilities
 	in the previous job was developing RESTful web services and integrating apps with them. 

	My team and I often had to look for non-standard solutions and select optimal tools for task 
 	implementation (for example, considering advantages and drawbacks of Kafka and RabbitMQ) with 
  	many factors of perspective usage being considered.

	I also performed unit testing and conducted code review. I believe code review provides vast opportunities 
 	for building rapport with your peers, improving the code and thus, delivering quality product.

	My experience of cooperating with all the team including front-enders, devops, designers and business
 	analysts during stand-ups, sprint planning and retrospective meetings help me remember how important it is 
  	to always keep a bigger picture in mind for the product's success. 

Human touch

	I’m quite a people person and a good team player, so I always choose to spend time with a big company of friends
 	in my downtime. I also vote for team sports such as football and beach volleyball. If I feel down, a good mug 
  	of coffee always makes me feel better and full of beans. 


Closure: signalizing the end of the self-pitch by inviting questions from the interviewer

	That’s what I was going to share with you to start off. I’m ready to answer your questions if you have any. 
 	Would you like me to elaborate on anything in particular?

What are your strengths?

	I’m able to master new technologies when the project requires it.
	My teammates always highlighted that my comments on their pull requests were really helpful.

Why did you leave your previous job?

	At some moment, I realized I had to make a choice: to stay with the same company and continue applying 
 	my expertise for solving a scope of familiar tasks or to try something new. I believe that I could 
  	learn a lot working here as well as bring value to the company with my expertise.

## после окончания интервью необходимо задать два самых важных вопроса:

	как вы видите идеального кандидата на данную вакансию? 
	How do you see the perfect candidate for this role?

	представьте что я нанят на эту должность. Что вы мне посоветуете чтобы я был успешен в течении одного - трех месяцев. 
	Imagine, if I am hired. What would yo recommend me to succeed at work in my first one to three months?

## Behavioral part (поведенческое интервью):

1) Нагуглить ценности компании (values)  - это по сути как мини конституция компании.
2) На каждую ценность написать небольшой рассказик - что для тебя значит эта ценность. Это поможет произвести вау эффект.
3) Проанализировать продукт компании и на интервью задать вопросы по этому продукту.

# SMALL TALK

Почти все разговоры формата small talk так или иначе начинаются с How are you? и это нормально. Другие формы с тем же смыслом:

	How are you doing? 
	How are you doing today?
	How has your day been so far? 
    How is it going?
    How do you do?
    What's up? (informal, american)
    How you have been?
    How've you been?
    How are things?
    Hi ya (very informal, american) / heya (british)
    How are things with you?
    What's new?
    How's life?
    
  Типичные нейтральные ответы:

  	Fine, 
	Fantastic, 
	Pretty good, 
	I’m doing great, thanks for asking. 
	Couldn’t be better! And yourself?
	A bit busy but fine all in all. How are you?
    I'm fine, thank you
    Not bad at all. What about you?
    Not too bad. You? (british)
    So far so good
    I'm doing well
    Great, thank you. How are you?
    Good, thanks, and you?
    Great, great, thanks
    Fine, thanks. It’s a beautiful day.
    I'm good (тот же ответ если вам предлагают напиток, а вы отказываетесь)


Если вы оказались вовлечены в разговор ни о чем и хотите сбежать потому что уже долго говорите:

    It was nice catching up with you
    It was interesting to hear about ...

 	meeting rooms along the way! Cool!

    I saw your post about that new project you completed recently. Great job!
    Thanks! I learned a lot while working on that project.

## Here are 10 situations simulating conversations between a PHP developer and an HR recruiter during a phone call, along with example dialogues.

### 1. **Initial Introduction and Icebreaker**
- **Situation**: The HR recruiter calls the PHP developer for the first time, starting with small talk before diving into the interview questions.
  
**HR**: *Hi [Developer’s name], how are you doing today? Thanks for taking the time to chat with me!*  
**Developer**: *I’m doing well, thanks! I appreciate the opportunity to connect. How’s your day going?*  
**HR**: *Busy but good! Let’s dive right in—can you tell me a little about your background and how you got into PHP development?*

---

### 2. **Discussing Work Experience**
- **Situation**: The recruiter asks about the developer’s previous work experience, specifically focusing on PHP-related projects.

**HR**: *Could you walk me through some of the PHP projects you've worked on recently?*  
**Developer**: *Sure! In my last position, I built a custom e-commerce platform using PHP and Laravel. I was responsible for both the backend architecture and implementing payment gateway integration.*  
**HR**: *That sounds impressive. Did you work with any front-end technologies as well?*

---

### 3. **Salary Expectations**
- **Situation**: The recruiter asks the developer about salary expectations early in the conversation.

**HR**: *So, let’s talk about salary. What are your expectations for compensation in this role?*  
**Developer**: *I’ve done some research, and I believe a range between $80,000 to $90,000 would be fair, depending on the benefits and growth opportunities.*  
**HR**: *That sounds reasonable. We’ll keep that in mind as we move forward.*

---

### 4. **Technical Skills Assessment**
- **Situation**: The recruiter needs to evaluate the developer’s PHP expertise.

**HR**: *Can you tell me about your experience with frameworks like Laravel or Symfony?*  
**Developer**: *I’m very comfortable with Laravel—I've been working with it for about 3 years now. I’ve built several RESTful APIs and also worked with Eloquent ORM for database management.*  
**HR**: *That’s great! Have you used Symfony as well?*

---

### 5. **Cultural Fit Discussion**
- **Situation**: The HR recruiter wants to gauge how well the developer will fit into the company culture.

**HR**: *What kind of company culture do you thrive in?*  
**Developer**: *I enjoy working in collaborative environments where communication is open and feedback is encouraged. I like when teams are agile and everyone can contribute to the decision-making process.*  
**HR**: *That aligns well with our team! We emphasize collaboration here.*

---

### 6. **Handling Remote Work**
- **Situation**: The recruiter asks about the developer's preferences and experience with remote work.

**HR**: *How do you feel about remote work? Have you worked in a fully remote environment before?*  
**Developer**: *Yes, I’ve been working remotely for the last two years. I’ve found that I’m very productive in that setting, and I use tools like Slack and Jira to stay connected with my team.*  
**HR**: *Good to hear! We offer flexible remote options, so that experience is a plus.*

---

### 7. **Discussing Career Goals**
- **Situation**: The recruiter asks about the developer's long-term goals.

**HR**: *Where do you see yourself in the next 3 to 5 years?*  
**Developer**: *I’d like to continue growing as a full-stack developer, but I’m also interested in moving into a leadership role where I can mentor junior developers.*  
**HR**: *That’s fantastic! We’re always looking for people with leadership potential.*

---

### 8. **Clarifying Job Description**
- **Situation**: The developer asks for clarification on the job responsibilities.

**Developer**: *Could you tell me more about the day-to-day responsibilities for this position?*  
**HR**: *Of course! You’ll be working primarily on backend PHP development, maintaining existing applications, and building new features. There will also be some opportunity to work with DevOps on CI/CD pipelines.*  
**Developer**: *That sounds like a good fit for my skillset.*

---

### 9. **Discussing Team Dynamics**
- **Situation**: The HR recruiter explains the team setup, and the developer asks about collaboration.

**HR**: *You’ll be joining a team of five developers. Everyone works closely together, and we have daily stand-ups.*  
**Developer**: *That sounds great! How do the teams typically collaborate—do you follow agile methodologies?*  
**HR**: *Yes, we follow Agile with two-week sprints. Collaboration and communication are key.*

---

### 10. **Closing the Conversation**
- **Situation**: The recruiter wraps up the call and outlines the next steps.

**HR**: *It’s been great talking with you! We’ll be moving on to the technical interview next. Do you have any questions for me before we end?*  
**Developer**: *Thanks for the chat! Just curious, what’s the timeline for the next steps?*  
**HR**: *We’re aiming to complete interviews by the end of next week, so you’ll hear from us shortly after that.*  
**Developer**: *Perfect! Looking forward to it.*  

These situations give a balanced mix of small talk, professional inquiries, and technical discussions commonly found in HR-developer phone conversations.

These messages are adaptable and can be tailored to the tone you wish to set with the HR professional. Remember to be polite and concise, and personalize each message to increase the chance of a positive response.


---

## РАЗНОЕ

---

Instead of searching for job postings, you should look for messages from HRs. For example, search on LinkedIn with key phrases like "hiring your profession city," and reach out to them directly or respond in the comments. It’s said that this method has a much higher conversion rate.
  
---

Talk about how well you understand legacy code in record time, or how you’ve seen and understand different approaches to processes.

---

### Work relationships are market relationships. One person sells their services and time, the other buys them. If the price isn't right, the seller looks for another buyer, and the buyer looks for another seller. If finding a suitable price doesn't work, negotiations begin. There's no place for personal grudges here.

---

### The only way forward is to let go and not worry about the level of your language skills. Remember that the official language of Europe is "bad English," and just push straight ahead toward your goal. That's it.

---

### Many companies operate in English, aiming for an international team or market. If you can pass a technical interview in English, then you won't face any issues during the work. The same goes for German.

---

### How do you learn?

1. Naturally, by updating my language skills on work projects and keeping up with other tools.
2. Pet projects – to explore other practices and technologies.
3. Reading books – to gain some fundamental knowledge.
4. Algorithms – to study interesting problem-solving strategies.

---

### Why did you choose our company?

1. **The product** – I looked at your product; I liked it and am interested in working with it. I have also partially worked with it before.
2. **Outsourcing** – I have previously worked partially in outstaffing, and your vacancy overall appealed to me. It could also help me grow in terms of technologies.

---

### What about the salary?

1. **During the screening**:
   - If the range is mentioned, give a salary within that range.
   - If the range is higher than your expected salary, DO NOT UNDERCUT. State a salary from the range instead – undercutting will not give you a competitive advantage, period.
   - If no range is provided, say that you're not very familiar with current market trends as you recently started interviewing. Ask what range they have in mind.
   - If you know your minimum range, state it to ensure you're not losing out on salary.

2. **After technical interviews**:
   - Here, you can negotiate.
   - You can leverage other offers, but do it carefully.
   - At this point, they are likely comparing you with other candidates.
   - If you've passed the technical stage, don't hesitate to state your desired salary.

---

### What do you expect from colleagues?

- NO specifics – just that I want people to be good and reasonable.
- I just want to do the work, no special expectations.

---

### Tell me about yourself

- No more than a minute.
- Don't mention any problems – you're the ideal employee who NEVER COMPLAINS.
- Don't bring up things that might reduce your reliability – like health issues, documentation problems, etc.
- Don’t mention crazy career expectations – they might think you’ll leave the company soon.
- Simply say that you're an AVERAGE WORKER – you have a gaming console, a bike, a wife, a child, and are considering a mortgage – someone WITHOUT BIG COMMITMENTS is more likely to leave the job, while a family man is more likely to put up with things.
- DON'T INTERPRET ANYTHING – keep it simple, as certain details can be interpreted either positively or negatively.

---

### How do you choose between two urgent tasks?

1. I will inform the team lead and the project manager.
2. If I decide on my own, I choose the one I can complete faster and then do the second task.

---

### What is most important at work?

- Give the impression that you're a GOOD WORKER – someone without issues, who does what they’re told, is neutral about work, gets along with colleagues, and isn’t stressed by challenges.
- Don’t give any SPECIFIC DETAILS – just vaguely explain that you simply want to do the work. When there are complex tasks, you switch to easier ones; if conflicts arise, you deal with them, and when bored, you ask if there’s anything else to do. Sometimes, you take on new projects to develop your skills, and if you're too tired, you take a day off.
- IDEAL ANSWER – say there’s nothing specific that bothers you. This suggests you don't have reasons to complain. Just explain how you deal with things, and it will become clear that YOU’RE A RELIABLE GUY.

---

### Why should we hire you?

- I don’t know – because I'll have to praise myself.
- Based on the job posting, I seem to fit the role.
- There are certain details to clarify, but we'll figure those out in the process.
- I can handle the work and will integrate well into the team.
- I'm interested in this job, and I think I can handle it.

---

### What do you like about work?

- Don’t go into too much detail.
- I’ve been lucky with work – I haven't faced major difficulties.
- I like my colleagues.
- The pay is good.
- There's room for growth.
- I can’t pick just one thing – there are many interesting aspects.

---

### How do you see your development within our company?

- What if it’s a horrible legacy codebase?
- You have a lot of projects – I’ll be able to grow and improve my skills.
- I'm interested in the processes.
- I'm intrigued by the business domain.
- I’d like to become a tech lead eventually.

---

### What would you do if the manager asked for a hotfix?

- If it's a regular occurrence, I’d create a task for it.
- If it’s a minor, irregular issue, I’d just do it.
- Document it properly.
- Determine the correct priority for such fixes.

---

### When can you start working?

- If the goal is just interview practice, you can receive an offer and not accept it, or say that you got a better offer and already accepted it.
- I will clarify the details and let you know the approximate start date.

---

### What to do if there’s chaos in the processes?

- Show that you won’t run away in such a situation.
- Figure out what’s going on.
- Find out if it’s a regular issue.
- Ask the manager how to handle it.
- Offer to help the manager or colleagues.

---

### What are your first steps in a new job?

- I’ll listen to you on the first day.
- I’ll review the available documentation.
- I’ll check access permissions and repositories.
- Get familiar with the first task.
- Set up the projects.
- After the first weeks, I’ll ask the team lead for feedback.

---

### Do you have any hobbies?

- Avoid mentioning anything unusual.
- Avoid hobbies that take up too much time.
- Avoid things that interfere with work.
- Just DON'T STAND OUT – you're an ordinary person without strange hobbies.

---

### Why are you looking for a job? (Not why you left your previous one)

- If you worked there for a long time, simply mention foundational issues – legacy code, etc.
- It’s important to show that you're not crazy but a normal person.

---

### Why did you leave your previous job?

- NEVER badmouth previous colleagues or the company – if you worked at a bad company, it reflects on you.
- MAIN REASON – organizational issues – moved, worked on documents, solved long-term problems, and persevered.
- DON'T SAY you're tired of the tech stack or want to work with new tools – it’s a red flag suggesting you’ll leave in six months for something new.
- DON'T MENTION past conflicts or failures at your old job.

---

### What is the most important thing at work?

- Answer vaguely without specifics.
- I’m just looking for a job.
- I’m looking for a team – either to learn from someone or to teach someone.
- I don’t have any particular demands.

---

### Three of your positive qualities

- Consistency.
- I enjoy my work – no significant burnout.
- I like interacting with colleagues – interesting people.

---

### How do you handle conflict situations?

- DON’T USE real stories.
- Make something up that’s SIMPLE and REFINED – there was a task where the team lead set a development strategy, code styles, and feature deployment rules, but the manager wanted the task closed quickly. The problem was that they couldn’t agree because both were right. So, I reached out to colleagues – we found a similar task that had been solved before, and we finished the task on time while following all the development rules. In the end, I suggested we create a plan for future situations like this. Meaning, you weren’t part of the conflict but helped solve it! You’re so cool that you never argue with anyone and are tactful in all situations.
