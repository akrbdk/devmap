### Tell me about yourself

Sure, so, my name is Alexander, and I am 31 years old.

I am a PHP developer with over 6 years of experience. My professional experience includes support and development of web
services.

In my most recent job, I was involved in a number of commerce projects where I was in charge of implementing web design solutions 
as well as maintaining the database. In my previous job, I was responsible for maintaining and updating our company website. 
I truly enjoyed what I was doing, which is what drew me to apply for this position.

I have some background in engineering science. I graduated from the Donbass State Engineering Academy and I have 
a Master's degree in Mechanical Engineering.

I started out as a back-end developer but soon started taking on database and server management tasks. I have a strong
background in PHP as well as MySQL and MongoDB. I am proficient in Laravel, PHP, Go, and Python.

I am also skilled at using Git. I’m always working towards updating my skills and keeping up with the industry. This is
why I’ve recently started taking JS courses. So far, I love the experience.

I’m a perfectionist. I pay attention to all the details and like to be sure that everything is just right. I’m a
creative thinker. I like to explore alternative solutions to problems. I enjoy solving problems and troubleshooting
issues in a timely manner. I work well under pressure. I am an excellent communicator.

My time management skills are excellent. I’m organized and efficient. This enables me to be as productive as possible on
the job. When working on a project, I don’t want just to meet deadlines. I prefer to complete the task well ahead of
schedule and as a result I always make my managers to be proud of me.

I am looking for a position, in which I can use my experience. I am more interested in a full-time position. My goal right now 
is to find a position at a company where I can grow and take on new challenges over time. 

Although I love my current role, I feel I’m now ready for a more challenging assignment and this position really excites
me. I believe that my experience with technology, specifically in the programming space, makes me the best match for this
position. If you hire me, I will do my best to exceed your highest expectations. I want this job because the role matches what 
I am looking for the next step in my career growth and also because I am very drawn to the mission and values that this company stands for.

You should hire me because I’m not only qualified for this job due to my experiences, but also because of the positive
attitudes that I have towards the tasks given to me. You should hire me because I have the ability to develop my skills.

In five years, I’d like to be an industry expert in my field, able to train and mentor students and entry-level
specialists alike.

My salary expectation is between $*** and $***, which is the average salary for a candidate with my level of experience
in this city.

### Tell me more about yourself

Well, I’ve always been interested in tech.

But it all probably started when I studied at school, and at the age of 16 I first got my computer.

I always loved playing around with code and learning new things. But it wasn’t until that high school where I first had
my first class about IT that really made me fall in love with the subject.

Throughout my study at school, I’ve noticed that I’ve always been good with numbers and handling data. Since then, I started 
learning more about IT and decided to major in IT.

As for my hobbies, they are bicycling and playing computer games.

### What are your biggest strengths and weaknesses?

I’ve always considered myself an organized and result-driven person. I make sure that the tools and approaches we choose
are right for the project and will result in a product that satisfies the customer’s needs.

I’m all about delivering solutions promptly, and I don’t like to overcomplicate things. For instance, I try to keep my
code clean and easy to read so that another person can take over my work if need be or if I have to go back and make
some changes, I don’t get mixed up and confused. I think a big part of being organized is being able to look at the big
picture and ask yourself what may come in the future.

I actually think my English could use some improvement. In the past, my fear of communicating in English has prevented
me from taking an active part in meetings. I also used to lack the confidence to write to my colleagues or the client
team, because, I think, there were a few instances when they thought I was a bit impolite over email.

However, it is something I am working on at the moment. I’ve been attending English classes for three months now, and I
feel like I’m getting over my fear of talking in meetings. I am still working on writing good emails, and I think I’m
making progress.

### Which skills would you say are critical for working with a team?

For me, three critical skills when working with a team are time management, communication, and conflict resolution.

Time management skills and communication can affect the speed and quality of work completed by the team, which is why I
highly value these skills in the workplace.

Conflict resolution is also essential—it’s a behavioral soft skill that can enhance team members’ ability to get along
with others and therefore also affects productivity.

### What is your task prioritization process?

I tend to use a to-do list to break down each project into easier tasks, then order all tasks by priority, and work my
way through the list by completing the most urgent or critical tasks first.

### What is your approach to handling project delays?

To handle project delays, I hold frequent meetings until the project is completed and re-prioritize tasks as needed. If
it becomes apparent that further delays might occur, I’d encourage communication, attempt to minimize delays by
reassigning specific tasks, and ask for help from other teams or colleagues.

### How do you make sure you’re constantly improving your skills?

One of my goals is to learn about new technology. My approach involves studying and using self-learning behavioral
approaches to keep up-to-date. I put my technological knowledge into practice by implementing new skills at work.

For example, I enhanced the code quality of my organization’s website with the knowledge I had gained through a self-study course
in the best practices of refactoring.

### How would you describe your communication skills?

I believe that listening is a critical part of communication and I’d say that I’m a discerning listener. I’d go as far
as to say that listening should be a priority during communication. Once you have all the necessary information, you can
then break it down into smaller parts to explain it to other team members.

### How do you respond to negative feedback or bad reviews? What is your process?

For me, empathy is an essential behavioral soft skill that can help when responding to negative feedback or reviews. I
always express my sympathy when a service or product doesn’t meet a customer’s expectations, ask questions to clarify
the reasons for this, and try to better understand their feedback and get to the core of the problem.

### Has there been a time that you gave negative feedback to an employee?

When giving negative feedback, I balance it with positive feedback, and I also use tact and respect.
I relay both sides of my feedback to encourage them and point out ways that they could improve.

### How do you motivate other team members?

I use three fundamental approaches to motivate team members and help them achieve goals.

First, I clearly establish what the goal is and recognize the eventual difficulties in achieving it. Then, I advise on
the goal and the specific approach that could be used. For example, if a co-worker needed to understand how to fix bugs
in their code, I would advise them on the specific debugging tool to use in their case.

Finally, I would check with them frequently to see how they are progressing with the goal.

### What is your approach to providing accurate estimates for the time you need to complete a task?

As a programmer, I often time myself when writing programs for different clients. This way, I have a good idea of how
long certain projects will take. However, if it’s a big project, I break it down into further smaller tasks, then
estimate the time I need for each task.

### Which steps do you take to plan your tasks?

As I’m always aiming to be meticulous and precise, I plan tasks thoroughly. A part of my approach to planning involves
looking at the bigger picture and the end goal, dividing the project into several sections, and setting deadlines to
achieve each goal.

### What is your approach when starting a new task?

When starting to work on a new task, I like to be prepared. I use verbal communication and active listening skills to clarify 
what needs to be done. I then use problem-solving skills to divide the task into easier sub-tasks. And finally, I make 
a plan to tackle each sub-task methodically. I welcome feedback to improve and implement any changes that are needed.

### You receive unclear instructions for a task. What steps do you take to handle it?

Before I proceed with a task, I always make sure I understand the instructions and do the necessary research to figure
out what I need to do to complete it. If I still don’t understand everything, I approach the team lead or project manager 
and ask questions to clarify the requirements. I always ask what the result should be and, if unclear, ask for an example.

### Tell me about a time when you failed a task. How did you learn from this experience?

In my first month as a PHP developer, I wanted to impress a client and overpromised a project timeline. Unfortunately,
the team didn't have the resources to deliver by the deadline I'd promised, and we ended up losing the client. I reached
out to the client and took full responsibility for the loss, and they gave us another chance. Because of this
experience, I learned the value of setting realistic expectations and never guaranteeing more than I could deliver.

In my previous software engineering role, I was unable to fix a bug in my code. As a result, I was not on time for the
release, so I was unable to meet the deadline. I have since learned several bug-fixing techniques to improve my
efficiency and output. Additionally, I always aim to develop knowledge of areas in which I’m not as confident.

### Which skills do you believe are essential for leadership?

I think soft skills are critical for leadership positions. Empathy and understanding non-verbal cues are key to
assisting a team. I also challenge myself to be a good role model and use active listening during team collaboration.

For instance, during discussions about problems we’re facing, I set an example and encourage others to listen to other
team members.

### Is meeting deadlines or producing quality work more important to you?

As a software engineer, I know that quality is essential. Though I always try to meet deadlines, rigorous testing is
critical and I consider this the priority. I knew the deadline was approaching in a previous project, but testing had
revealed a few errors. I prioritized fixing the errors because quality was more important for the team.

### Tell me about a time you had to acquire new skills within a short period. How did you achieve this?

When I was about to begin a new role as a middle software engineer, I had to refresh my knowledge of a programming
language that I hadn’t used in a while. I quickly took a look at a few open-source projects I had produced. I refreshed 
my memory and played around with the code and practiced my skills . When I began the role, I felt more confident.

### What is your biggest challenge when starting a new role?

For me, adapting to the company culture is the biggest challenge. But I’m open-minded, I embrace change, and I’m
adaptable. I always learn as much as possible about the company before starting and try to embrace the core values and
principles of the business.

### What Are Your Career Goals

I know that it’s become more and more helpful to know Python in the context of data science, so I plan on learning it this
year. It will come in handy when solving portfolio optimization problems. As far as long-term goals, I would like to become 
a fullstack-developer.

### Why did you leave your last job? / Why are you leaving your current position / Why do you want to work here?

While I’m grateful to my previous employer for giving me the opportunity to learn and grow in my career, I feel like, at
this point, I’m not fully satisfied with the work I’m doing. I would love to do something more meaningful and useful and
get more involved into working on a diverse range of projects where I can collaborate with passionate people and learn
new approaches and technologies. I would love to work at a cutting-edge company that tries to make a positive impact in
the world.

### Tell me about the biggest challenge you’ve ever had

It’s hard to point it out off the top of my head. Well, there was this one time, when we had to work with a client who
did not provide clear requirements which caused a lot of confusion. Once he asked to add a certain feature three weeks
before the deadline, and we had very little time for testing it.

I had to run all the needed tests and make sure the product was ready to be released.

Because the process was very time-consuming, and we were on a very tight deadline, I decided to eliminate the most
critical bugs and issues first. We held a meeting with the team to determine which issues we should prioritize and got
to work. In the end, we managed to deliver a functioning product and the client was happy with it.

### What would you do if a manager asked you to perform a task you've never done before?

In my last role as a software engineer, my manager asked me to build and launch a new Go app, which was something I'd never
done before. I explained to my manager that I had no experience leading that type of project but volunteered to do all
the work if someone more experienced could offer guidance. I met with several coworkers who had experience running Go
apps, studied best practices, and successfully launched the app. Thanks to that hands-on learning experience, I became
the team expert on Go.

### What would you do if you made a mistake no one noticed?

I've always found it's better to take responsibility for your mistakes than to learn from your errors. When I worked as
a junior PHP developer, a client asked for a fast fix in the project and I accidentally made a bug. While there's a
chance they may never have known, I knew my error could affect their experience. I promptly told my manager, remade the
task and apologized to the client for the wait. The client felt satisfied, and my manager thanked me for doing the right
thing. From that point forward, I paid special attention to fast fixes.

### Tell me about a time you set a personal goal for yourself. How did you ensure you would meet your objectives and what steps did you take?

I think the most recent, and important, personal goal that comes to mind is that I managed to teach myself
web development from scratch. You see, I wasn’t very satisfied as an engineer at Heavy Machinery's Plant. My coworkers
were nice, and the pay was decent too, but I just didn’t see myself growing there.

So, I decided that I wanted a career change in a field I’ve always been interested in - web development. Now,
because I was working full-time, I had to be very efficient with my time-management skills.

I did some research, and all that was left to do was just follow my routine and stay committed. I set up a
personal calendar and made sure to study HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for at least 2 hours every day. I gathered a list of
beginner-friendly books to start with, and once I was done with those, I paid for some advanced online courses to
improve my HTML and PHP skills. When I felt comfortable, I started working on some personal projects for my
portfolio and did some freelance work part-time while I was still working at Plant.

In the end, I’m glad I stuck to my plan and continued with my set curriculum. If I did not have my calendar
planned out with specific objectives, I surely would have been overwhelmed. Sure, at times, it felt like I was basically
working 2 jobs and that a lot of the material wasn’t making sense. But I just kept moving forward, and then, I got my
first real break as a junior web dev at Company CorpY.


### Tell me about your first job in the industry. What did you do to learn the ropes?

Well, my first job in the field was as a junior PHP programmer. While I did have extensive knowledge of the
field, I didn’t have too much experience doing it.

This made it very hard for me to get started with the job. While I was working almost all the time, I wasn’t
getting too much done.

So, what I did was, taking a lot of my personal time to really work and learn the ins and outs of programming.
I also made sure to talk to my team members and get their input on daily tasks.

A few months into the job, I managed to learn the ropes and ended up being a lot more productive.

### Why Do You Want to Work Here?

I've seen your portfolio, and it's really inspired me to apply! I love working with a team to achieve a common goal, and
I know my background in production has prepared me for this role. I look forward to becoming a valued contributor to
this phenomenal team.

I've seen your company consistently listed as one of the top places to work. I've read employee testimonials and heard
how you encourage employee growth through education, training, and vast resources. I would love to join your innovative
team, continue to create great work, and grow within the company by further improving my skills.

I specifically want to work here because I read your company’s mission and vision. After finding out more information
about your company from social media, I can clearly see how my goals align with that of the company. There's nothing I
love more than when I am working with other engaged individuals toward a common goal, and that's what excited me about
working here.

Before the recruiter called me about this opportunity, I must admit that I didn't know much about your company. I've
been doing some research in preparation for this discussion, and I need to say that I'm impressed by your work and your
vision for the future. As an experienced programmer with an emphasis on technology, I know I can bring
a lot of value to the team.
