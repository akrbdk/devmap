### Tell me about yourself

#### Intro

Let me tell you a couple of words about myself.
My name is Alex. I’ve been a PHP developer for seven years in web development. I’m going to walk you through those of my skills
that I feel could make me a good fit for the position.

#### Main part

I’ve got experience developing and maintaining PHP services. In my last role, I worked on complex custom commerce projects, 
implemented frontend solutions, database management, and maintaining web services. 
I’m skilled in PHP, MySQL and frameworks like Laravel. I’ve also worked with Go, and I’m currently learning advanced JavaScript.

I am well understanding legacy code in record time, and I’ve seen and understand different approaches to processes.

My experience of cooperating with all the team including front-enders, devops, designers and business
analysts during stand-ups, sprint planning and retrospective meetings help me remember how important it is 
to always keep a bigger picture in mind for the product's success.

I am looking for a position, in which I can use my experience. I am more interested in a full-time position.
I’m excited about this position because it offers opportunities to grow, face new challenges, and work with a team that values innovation.

#### More about yourself?

I have a Master’s degree in Mechanical Engineering, which helps me approach problems analytically.

To tell the truth, I’ve always been interested in tech.
It all started when I got my first computer at 16. I loved experimenting with code and learning new things.
But it was in high school, during my first IT class, that I really fell in love with technology.
I’ve always been good with numbers and working with data, so I decided to focus on IT and deepen my knowledge from there.

#### Human touch

I’m quite a people person and a good team player, so I always choose to spend time with a big company of friends in my downtime.
I have a gaming console, a bike, a wife, a child, and are considering a mortgage))
In my free time, I enjoy bicycling and playing computer games to recharge and stay creative.

#### Closure: signalizing the end of the self-pitch by inviting questions from the interviewer

That’s what I was going to share with you to start off. I’m ready to answer your questions if you have any. 
Would you like me to elaborate on anything in particular?

However, I’ve been attending English classes now and feel more confident in meetings. 
- I’m still working on improving my written communication, and I’m making progress.

---

### How do you learn?

1. Naturally, by updating my language skills on work projects and keeping up with other tools.
2. Pet projects – to explore other practices and technologies. Sometimes, I take on new projects to develop my skills, and if I am too tired, I take a day off.
3. Reading books – to gain some fundamental knowledge.
4. Algorithms – to study interesting problem-solving strategies.

---

### How do you choose between two urgent tasks?

1. I will inform the team lead and the project manager.
2. If I decide on my own, I choose the one I can complete faster and then do the second task.

---

### What do you expect from colleagues?

- NO specifics – just that I want people to be good and reasonable.
- There’s nothing specific that bothers me - I just want to do the work, no special expectations

---

### Why did you choose our company?

1. **The product** – I looked at your product; I liked it and am interested in working with it. I have also partially worked with it before.
2. **Outsourcing** – I have previously worked partially in outstaffing, and your vacancy overall appealed to me. It could also help me grow in terms of technologies.

---

### Which skills would you say are critical for working with a team?

I believe time management, communication, and conflict resolution are key.

- **Time management** ensures tasks are completed efficiently.
- **Communication** ensures everyone is on the same page and work quality remains high.
- **Conflict resolution** helps maintain a positive team dynamic, which ultimately boosts productivity.

---

### Three of your positive qualities

- Consistency.
- I enjoy my work – no significant burnout.
- I like interacting with colleagues – interesting people.

---

### What is your task prioritization process?

I break down projects into smaller tasks and prioritize them based on urgency. I tackle the most critical tasks first and 
work my way through the list, ensuring everything is completed on time.

---

### What is your approach to handling project delays?

I hold regular meetings to track progress and re-prioritize tasks. If delays are expected, I communicate clearly, reassign tasks, 
and seek help from colleagues or other teams to minimize the impact.

---

### How do you make sure you’re constantly improving your skills?

I focus on self-learning by studying new technologies and implementing them in my work. For example, I improved the code 
quality on my team’s website after completing a self-study course on refactoring best practices.

---

### How would you describe your communication skills?

I value listening and believe it’s a crucial part of communication. I ensure I fully understand the information before 
breaking it down and explaining it to others in simpler terms.

---

### How do you respond to negative feedback or bad reviews? What is your process?

For me, empathy is an essential behavioral soft skill that can help when responding to negative feedback or reviews. I
always express my sympathy when a service or product doesn’t meet a customer’s expectations, ask questions to clarify
the reasons for this, and try to better understand their feedback and get to the core of the problem.

---

### Has there been a time that you gave negative feedback to an employee?

When giving negative feedback, I balance it with positive feedback, and I also use tact and respect.
I relay both sides of my feedback to encourage them and point out ways that they could improve.

---

### How do you motivate other team members?

I use three fundamental approaches to motivate team members and help them achieve goals.

First, I clearly establish what the goal is and recognize the eventual difficulties in achieving it. Then, I advise on
the goal and the specific approach that could be used. For example, if a co-worker needed to understand how to fix bugs
in their code, I would advise them on the specific debugging tool to use in their case.

Finally, I would check with them frequently to see how they are progressing with the goal.

---

### What is your approach to providing accurate estimates for the time you need to complete a task?

As a programmer, I often time myself when writing programs for different clients. This way, I have a good idea of how
long certain projects will take. However, if it’s a big project, I break it down into further smaller tasks, then
estimate the time I need for each task.

---

### Which steps do you take to plan your tasks?

I plan meticulously by dividing projects into smaller tasks, setting deadlines for each, and focusing on the end goal.
I always keep the bigger picture in mind to stay on track.

---

### What is your approach when starting a new task?

I clarify the requirements through communication, break the task down into smaller steps, and make a detailed plan 
to execute each sub-task. I welcome feedback to make improvements along the way.

---

### You receive unclear instructions for a task. What steps do you take to handle it?

Before I proceed with a task, I always make sure I understand the instructions and do the necessary research to figure
out what I need to do to complete it. If I still don’t understand everything, I ask the team lead or project manager for
clarification. I always ask what the result should be and, if unclear, ask for an example.

---

### Tell me about a time when you failed a task. How did you learn from this experience?

- **Situation**: In my first month as a PHP developer, I promised a client an unrealistic timeline.  
- **Task**: I had to deliver a project in a short time, but we lacked the resources to meet the deadline.  
- **Action**: I took responsibility, apologized to the client, and they gave us another chance.  
- **Result**: I learned the importance of setting realistic expectations and never overpromising.

---

### Which skills do you believe are essential for leadership?

I think soft skills are critical for leadership positions. Empathy and understanding non-verbal cues are key to
assisting a team. I also challenge myself to be a good role model and use active listening during team collaboration.
For instance, during discussions about problems we’re facing, I set an example and encourage others to listen to other
team members.

---

### Is meeting deadlines or producing quality work more important to you?

As a software engineer, I know that quality is essential. Though I always try to meet deadlines, rigorous testing is
critical and I consider this the priority. I knew the deadline was approaching in a previous project, but testing had
revealed a few errors. I prioritized fixing the errors because quality was more important for the team.

---

### Tell me about a time you had to acquire new skills within a short period. How did you achieve this?

- **Situation**: I had to refresh my knowledge of a programming language I hadn’t used in a while - Golang.  
- **Task**: I needed to learn the language quickly for a new role.  
- **Action**: I reviewed open-source projects, practiced, and worked on real examples.  
- **Result**: When I started the role, I felt confident and was ready to contribute.

---

### What is your biggest challenge when starting a new role?

For me, adapting to the company culture is the biggest challenge. But I’m open-minded, I embrace change, and I’m
adaptable. I always learn as much as possible about the company before starting and try to embrace the core values and
principles of the business.

---

### What Are Your Career Goals?

I would like to become a full-stack developer and expand my skill set.

---

### Why did you leave your last job? / Why are you leaving your current position / Why do you want to work here?

While I’m grateful to my previous employer for giving me the opportunity to learn and grow in my career, I feel like, at
this point, I’m not fully satisfied with the work I’m doing. I would love to do something more meaningful and useful and
get more involved into working on a diverse range of projects where I can collaborate with passionate people and learn
new approaches and technologies. I would love to work at a cutting-edge company that tries to make a positive impact in
the world.

---

### Tell me about the biggest challenge you’ve ever had

- **Situation**: A client gave unclear requirements and asked for a feature close to the deadline.  
- **Task**: We had limited time for testing.  
- **Action**: I prioritized critical bugs, held a team meeting to decide the priorities, and focused on delivering the best product possible.  
- **Result**: We met the deadline and the client was happy.


- **Situation**: There was a task where the team lead set a development strategy, code styles, and feature deployment rules, but the manager wanted the task closed quickly.
- **Task**: The problem was that they couldn’t agree because both were right. 
- **Action**: So, I reached out to colleagues – we found a similar task that had been solved before, and we finished the task on time while following all the development rules.
- **Result**: In the end, I suggested we create a plan for future situations like this. Meaning, you weren’t part of the conflict but helped solve it! You’re so cool that you never argue with anyone and are tactful in all situations.

---

### What would you do if a manager asked you to perform a task you've never done before?

In my last role as a software engineer, my manager asked me to build and launch a new Go app, which was something I'd
never done before. I explained to my manager that I had no experience leading that type of project but volunteered to do all
the work if someone more experienced could offer guidance. I met with several coworkers who had experience running Go
apps, studied best practices, and successfully launched the app. Thanks to that hands-on learning experience, I became
the team expert on Go.

---

### What would you do if you made a mistake no one noticed?

I've always found it's better to take responsibility for your mistakes than to learn from your errors. When I worked as
a junior PHP developer, a client asked for a fast fix in the project and I accidentally made a bug. While there's a
chance they may never have known, I knew my error could affect their experience. I promptly told my manager, remade the
task and apologized to the client for the wait. The client felt satisfied, and my manager thanked me for doing the right
thing. From that point forward, I paid special attention to fast fixes.

---

### **Tell me about a time you set a personal goal for yourself. How did you ensure you would meet your objectives and what steps did you take?**

- **Situation:** I wasn’t happy working at a heavy machinery plant. My coworkers were great, but I wanted a career change to web development.
- **Task:** I set a goal to teach myself web development while working full-time.
- **Action:** I created a daily study schedule, dedicating 2 hours each day to learning HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I studied beginner books and later took advanced courses in PHP and HTML. I also worked on personal projects and freelanced part-time.
- **Result:** By sticking to my plan, I landed my first junior web developer role at Company.

---

### **Tell me about your first job in the industry. What did you do to learn the ropes?**

- **Situation:** My first job as a junior PHP programmer was challenging since I had theoretical knowledge but little hands-on experience.
- **Task:** I needed to quickly become productive.
- **Action:** I used my personal time to practice and understand the code better. I also sought advice from my team members on daily tasks.
- **Result:** Within a few months, I became more productive and integrated well into the team.

## Dialog structure

- **HR**: Hi Alex, how are you doing today? Thanks for taking the time to chat with me!


- **Developer**: I’m doing well, thanks! I appreciate the opportunity to connect. How’s your day going?


- **HR**: Busy but good! Please tell me what did you do last year and why have you been self-employed/unemployed?


- **Developer**: Over the last year, I’ve been focusing on personal and professional growth. I took the opportunity to work on improving my skills in PHP development and deeply learning JavaScript. Due to the move from Ukraine, as it was dangerous there, I had to wait for the documents for the last year and deal with other issues. And of course, I’ve been actively preparing for the job market in Europe. I relocated to Germany and dedicated time to learning the local job market dynamics, networking, and improving my language skills to better integrate into the professional environment here. I am still working on improving my German skills and I am now at the A2 level. The gap was an opportunity to focus on transition into a new chapter of my career. I’m now eager to apply my experience and the new skills I’ve acquired to contribute to impactful projects.


- **HR**: Let’s dive right in—can you tell me a little about your background and how you got into PHP development?


- **Developer**: Sure! I started my career with a background in mechanical engineering, but I’ve always been passionate about technology and problem-solving. Around seven years ago, I transitioned into web development and found my niche in PHP. I began by working on small projects, improving my skills in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and PHP. Over time, I’ve gained experience with frameworks like Laravel, Yii2, and Zend Framework. My work has mainly focused on building and maintaining complex systems, optimizing performance, and integrating APIs for real estate and construction companies. Would you like me to dive into any specific aspects of my experience?


- **HR**: That sounds impressive. Did you work with any front-end technologies as well?


- **Developer**: Yes, I do. While my primary focus has been on backend development, I’ve also worked on frontend projects when needed. I have experience with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, as well as integrating frontend components with backend systems and sometimes I refactored some logic of the frontend components - for example, widgets for our custom admin panel. I’m really interested in becoming more proficient in frontend development to contribute more effectively to full-stack projects. I'm going to become a fullstack developer.


- **HR**: Can you tell me about your experience with frameworks like Laravel or Symfony?


- **Developer**: Of course! I’m very comfortable with Laravel — I’ve been working with Laravel extensively for the past few years. It’s my go-to framework for building scalable and maintainable web applications. I’ve used it to develop features like property selectors, PDF generation, API integrations, and CRM modules for real estate projects. I’m particularly comfortable with Eloquent ORM, middleware, and creating RESTful APIs in Laravel. As for Symfony, I’ve explored it to understand its component-based structure and dependency injection, which I find quite powerful. While I don’t have as much hands-on experience with Symfony as with Laravel, I’m familiar with its principles and architecture. I’m confident I could quickly adapt to Symfony for a project if needed. Do you primarily use Laravel or Symfony in your projects, or is there a particular challenge you’re looking for me to help with?


- **HR**: Could you walk me through some of the PHP projects you've worked on recently?


- **Developer**: In my previous roles, I successfully delivered mid-to-large-scale software projects, developing robust backend systems and optimizing performance. One of my recent projects involved developing a real estate platform for a construction company. The platform featured an apartment search tool with advanced filtering options and a visual selector, allowing users to interactively browse floor plans and unit availability. I handled backend development using Laravel, integrating APIs - RabbitMQ, for data import/export. I also optimized the site for performance, including database queries and caching mechanisms. Another projects I worked on were automated PDF generation for brochures, image optimization module, and tools for managing content dynamically. In addition, I’ve worked on developing custom modules for SEO optimization, including sitemap generation and XML feeds. These projects not only strengthened my PHP and Laravel skills but also allowed me to collaborate with cross-functional teams to meet tight deadlines. If you’d like, I can go into more technical detail about any of these. Let me know!


- **HR**: Tell more detail about your projects and resposibilities


- **Developer**: Prewiously I worked at mid size company. The main clients are large construction companies, and there were also various other clients - an online store for motorcycles, and other small businesses.

    ```
    Initially, I worked as a specialist in the support department - there was a small team of technical specialists and managers.
    The number of projects was about 100 - these were projects on different frameworks and with different code quality.
    The tasks were small and often it was something urgent. The main tasks were refactoring, bug fixing, adding new features, etc.
    
    Then I worked in the development department - where the tasks were more complex - developing new projects. The company had a main 
    repository with a product that was adapted to the client's requirements. Sometimes there were completely custom projects - corporate 
    sites for large customers - there were many non-standard solutions - data import and various integrations with third-party services, 
    complex business logic, etc.
    
    ● Developed property sales websites with apartment search functionality
    ● Integrated complex data imports from various sources (RabbitMQ, APIs, XML, JSON, CSV), integrated client CRM systems
    ● Provided technical support for projects using Wordpress, Yii2, Bitrix, and Laravel,
    ● Optimized search relevance, performance, and security.
    ● Implemented Google PageSpeed recommendations, boosting site speed and performance through
    caching, image compression, and refactoring.
    ● Led technical audits, database optimization, and PHP updates, ensuring secure, efficient, and up-to-date
    systems.
    ```

- **HR**: What are you looking for in the new company?


- **Developer**: Developer: I’m looking for a company where I can continue to grow professionally while contributing my skills to meaningful projects. I’m particularly interested in joining a team where I can work on challenging projects, including those that involve both backend and frontend development, as I’m keen to strengthen my skills in modern frontend frameworks.


- **HR**: Where do you see yourself in the next 3 to 5 years?


- **Developer**: I’d like to continue growing as a full-stack developer, but I’m also interested in moving into a leadership role where I can mentor junior developers.


- **HR**: Please tell me what interesting books you've read for the last year?


- **Developer**: I've read The Clean Coder by Robert C. Martin - is an excellent book that focuses on professionalism and best practices in software development. And I've read The Culture Map by Erin Meyer. It's an insightful read about how different cultures approach communication, leadership, and collaboration in the workplace. For example, I've read interesting moments about cultures that prefer direct communication (like in the US or Germany) with those that are more indirect (such as Japan or Korea). Another fascinating part is, of how different cultures handle hierarchy in the workplace. For instance, in some countries like the Netherlands, the workplace is relatively egalitarian, while in countries like Japan, there is a clear respect for authority and seniority. The book helps to break down stereotypes and gives practical tips for building better cross-cultural relationships.


- **HR**: How do you feel about remote work? Have you worked in a fully remote environment before?


- **Developer**: Yes, I’ve been working remotely for the past few years - since 2020. I’ve found that I’m very productive in that setting, and I use tools like Slack and Jira to stay connected with my team.


- **Developer**: Could you tell me more about the day-to-day responsibilities for this position?


- **HR**: Of course! You’ll be working primarily on backend PHP development, maintaining existing applications, and building new features. There will also be some opportunity to work with DevOps on CI/CD pipelines.


- **Developer**: That sounds like a good fit for my skillset.


- **HR**: You’ll be joining a team of five developers. Everyone works closely together, and we have daily stand-ups.


- **Developer**: That sounds great! How do the teams typically collaborate — do you follow agile methodologies?


- **HR**: Yes, we follow Agile with two-week sprints. Collaboration and communication are key.


- **Developer**: Thanks for the chat! Just curious, what’s the timeline for the next steps?


- **HR**: We’re aiming to complete interviews by the end of next week, so you’ll hear from us shortly after that.


- **Developer**: Perfect! Looking forward to it.
