### Tell me about yourself

Sure, so, my name is Alexander, and I am 31 years old.

I am a PHP developer with over 6 years of experience. In my most recent job, I was involved in a number of commerce
projects where I was in charge of implementing web design solutions as well as maintaining the database.

I have some background in engineering science, with a degree from University X.

I started out as a front-end developer but soon started taking on database and server management tasks. I have a strong
background in PHP as well as MySQL and MongoDB. I am proficient in Laravel, PHP, Go, and Python.

I am also skilled at using Git. I’m always working towards updating my skills and keeping up with the industry. This is
why I’ve recently started taking AngularJS courses. So far, I love the experience.


=============================================


At my last job, I worked as a PHP developer.

I am looking for a position, in which I can use my experience. I am more interested in a full-time position. I am very
motivated to do this job – it’s my dream. If you hire me, I will do my best to exceed your highest expectations. My goal
right now is to find a position at a company where I can grow and take on new challenges over time.

I’m a perfectionist. I pay attention to all the details and like to be sure that everything is just right. I’m a
creative thinker. I like to explore alternative solutions to problems. I enjoy solving problems and troubleshooting
issues in a timely manner. I work well under pressure. I am an excellent communicator. I am a trouble shooter.

My time management skills are excellent. I’m organized and efficient. This enables me to be as productive as possible on
the job. When working on a project, I don’t want just to meet deadlines. I prefer to complete the task well ahead of
schedule and as a result I always make my managers to be proud of me.

You should hire me because I’m not only qualified for this job due to my experiences, but also because of the positive
attitudes that I have towards the tasks given to me. You should hire me because I have the ability to develop my skills.

In five years, I’d like to be an industry expert in my field, able to train and mentor students and entry-level
specialists alike.

My salary expectation is between $*** and $***, which is the average salary for a candidate with my level of experience
in this city.


### Tell me more about yourself

Well, I’ve always been interested in tech.

But it all probably started when I studied at school, and at the age of 16 I first got my computer.

I always loved playing around with code and learning new things. But it wasn’t until that high school where I first had
my first class about it that really made me fall in love with the subject.

Throughout my study at school, I’ve noticed that I’ve always been good with numbers and handling data.

Since then, I started learning more about it and decided to major in IT.

=============================================


I graduated from the Ukrainian Academy of Heavy Machinebuilding and I have a degree in Mechanical Engineering.

I have been working as a PHP developer for six years. My professional experience includes support and development of web services.

Although I love my current role, I feel I’m now ready for a more challenging assignment and this position really excites me.

I want this job because the role matches what I am looking for the next step in my career growth and also because I am very drawn to the mission and values that this company stands for.

As for my hobbies, they are bicycling and swimming.


### What are your biggest strengths and weaknesses?

I’ve always considered myself an organized and result-driven person. I make sure that the tools and approaches we choose
are right for the project and will result in a product that satisfies the customer’s needs.

I’m all about delivering solutions promptly, and I don’t like to overcomplicate things. For instance, I try to keep my
code clean and easy to read so that another person can take over my work if need be or if I have to go back and make
some changes, I don’t get mixed up and confused. I think a big part of being organized is being able to look at the big
picture and ask yourself what may come in the future.

============================

I actually think my English could use some improvement. In the past, my fear of communicating in English has prevented
me from taking an active part in meetings. I also used to lack the confidence to write to my colleagues or the client
team, because, I think, there were a few instances when they thought I was a bit impolite over email.

However, it is something I am working on at the moment. I’ve been attending English classes for three months now, and I
feel like I’m getting over my fear of talking in meetings. I am still working on writing good emails, and I think I’m
making progress.








### Which skills would you say are critical for working with a team?

For me, three critical skills when working with a team are time management, communication, and conflict resolution.

Time management skills and communication can affect the speed and quality of work completed by the team, which is why I highly value these skills in the workplace.

Conflict resolution is also essential—it’s a behavioral soft skill that can enhance team members’ ability to get along with others and therefore also affects productivity.

### What is your task prioritization process?

I tend to use a to-do list to break down each project into easier tasks, then order all tasks by priority, and work my way through the list by completing the most urgent or critical tasks first.

### What is your approach to handling project delays?

To handle project delays, I hold frequent meetings until the project is completed and re-prioritize tasks as needed. If it becomes apparent that further delays might occur, I’d encourage communication, attempt to minimize delays by reassigning specific tasks, and ask for help from other teams or colleagues.

### How do you make sure you’re constantly improving your skills?

One of my goals is to learn about new technology. My approach involves studying and using self-learning behavioral approaches to keep up-to-date. I put my technological knowledge into practice by implementing new skills at work.

For example, I enhanced the UX of my organization’s website with the knowledge I had gained through a self-study course in the best practices of UX design.

### How would you describe your communication skills?

I believe that listening is a critical part of communication and I’d say that I’m a discerning listener. I’d go as far as to say that listening should be a priority during communication. Once you have all the necessary information, you can then break it down into smaller parts to explain it to other team members.

### How do you respond to negative feedback or bad reviews? What is your process?

For me, empathy is an essential behavioral soft skill that can help when responding to negative feedback or reviews. I always express my sympathy when a service or product doesn’t meet a customer’s expectations, ask questions to clarify the reasons for this, and try to better understand their feedback and get to the core of the problem.

### Has there been a time that you gave negative feedback to an employee?

When giving negative feedback, I balance it with positive feedback, and I also use tact and respect.

For instance, once I noticed one of our copywriters did not fact-check a statistic they were quoting, but that the quality of the writing was good. I relayed both sides of my feedback to encourage them and point out ways that they could improve.

### How do you interact with co-workers who approach tasks differently?

I think using discretion and building trust with co-workers is essential when collaborating with them. Even if they used different approaches, I’d try to recognize their working style and acknowledge the strengths of their approach. I’d communicate with them regularly and try to use the skills we have in common to approach the task.

### How do you motivate other team members?

I use three fundamental approaches to motivate team members and help them achieve goals.

First, I clearly establish what the goal is and recognize the eventual difficulties in achieving it. Then, I advise on the goal and the specific approach that could be used. For example, if a co-worker needed to understand how to fix bugs in their code, I would advise them on the specific debugging tool to use in their case.

Finally, I would check with them frequently to see how they are progressing with the goal.

### What is your approach to providing accurate estimates for the time you need to complete a task?

As a programmer, I often time myself when writing programs for different clients. This way, I have a good idea of how long certain 
projects will take. However, if it’s a big project, I break it down into further smaller tasks, then estimate the time I need 
for each task.

### Which steps do you take to plan your tasks?

As I’m always aiming to be meticulous and precise, I plan tasks thoroughly. A part of my approach to planning involves looking at the bigger picture and the end goal, dividing the project into several sections, and setting deadlines to achieve each goal.

### You receive unclear instructions for a task. What steps do you take to handle it?

Before I proceed with a task, I always make sure I understand the instructions and do the necessary research to figure out what I need to do to complete it.

If I still don’t understand everything, I approach the team lead or project manager and ask questions to clarify the requirements. I always ask what the result should be and, if unclear, ask for an example.

### Have you ever failed to accomplish a task?

In my previous software engineering role, I was unable to fix a bug in my code. As a result, I was not on time for the release, so I was unable to meet the deadline. I have since learned several bug-fixing techniques to improve my efficiency and output. Additionally, I always aim to develop knowledge of areas in which I’m not as confident.

### Which skills do you believe are essential for leadership?

I think soft skills are critical for leadership positions. Empathy and understanding non-verbal cues are key to assisting a team. I also challenge myself to be a good role model and use active listening during team collaboration.

For instance, during discussions about problems we’re facing, I set an example and encourage others to listen to other team members.

### Is meeting deadlines or producing quality work more important to you?

As a software engineer, I know that quality is essential. Though I always try to meet deadlines, rigorous testing is critical and I consider this the priority. I knew the deadline was approaching in a previous project, but testing had revealed a few errors. I prioritized fixing the errors because quality was more important for the team.

### Tell me about a time you had to acquire new skills within a short period. How did you achieve this?

When I was about to begin a new role as a middle software engineer, I had to refresh my knowledge of a programming language that I hadn’t used in a while.

I quickly took a look at a few open-source projects I had produced. I refreshed my memory and played around with the code and practiced my PHP skills . When I began the role, I felt more confident.

### What is your biggest challenge when starting a new role?

For me, adapting to the company culture is the biggest challenge. But I’m open-minded, I embrace change, and I’m adaptable. I always learn as much as possible about the company before starting and try to embrace the core values and principles of the business.

### What is your approach when starting a new task?

When starting to work on a new task, I like to be prepared.

I use verbal communication and active listening skills to clarify what needs to be done. I then use problem-solving skills to divide the task into easier sub-tasks. And finally, I make a plan to tackle each sub-task methodically. I welcome feedback to improve and implement any changes that are needed.

### What Are Your Career Goals

I know that it’s become more and more helpful to know Python in the context of finance, so I plan on learning it this year. It will come in handy when solving portfolio optimization problems. 
As far as long-term goals, I would like to become a fullstack-developer.



### Why did you leave your last job? / Why are you leaving your current position / Why do you want to work here?

While I’m grateful to my previous employer for giving me the opportunity to learn and grow in my career, I feel like, at
this point, I’m not fully satisfied with the work I’m doing. I would love to do something more meaningful and useful and
get more involved into working on a diverse range of projects where I can collaborate with passionate people and learn
new approaches and technologies. I would love to work at a cutting-edge company that tries to make a positive impact in
the world.

### Tell me about the biggest challenge you’ve ever had

It’s hard to point it out off the top of my head. Well, there was this one time, when we had to work with a client who
did not provide clear requirements which caused a lot of confusion. Once he asked to add a certain feature three weeks
before the deadline, and we had very little time for testing it.

I had to run all the needed tests and make sure the product was ready to be released.

Because the process was very time-consuming, and we were on a very tight deadline, I decided to eliminate the most
critical bugs and issues first. We held a meeting with the team to determine which issues we should prioritize and got
to work. In the end, we managed to deliver a functioning product and the client was happy with it.

### Do you have any questions for me? (Questions to the employer)

- Why do you like working here?
- Where do you see this company in 5 years?
- What kinds of qualities are you looking for in people?
- What is your culture like?
- How do you evaluate performance?


- How many employees work for the organization?
- Please, tell me a little bit about the people with whom I’ll be working most closely.
- Will I work independently or in a team?
- Where will I be working?
- How advanced is the hardware and software I will be expected to use?
- How did this job become available?
- Before you’re able to reach a hiring decision, how many more interviews should I expect to go through and with whom?

### Explain how you were able to work effectively under pressure.

I worked on a crucial project that was supposed to be delivered to the client in twenty (20) days. My manager instructed
me to get the job ready in ten (10) days without losing time on our other projects. I responded by challenging my staff
to deliver the project to time, so added more time to our schedules, shared the workload appropriately, and we got the
project ready in eight (8) days.

My ability to effectively allocate the tasks among my already great team of staff I had was largely responsible for the
success of the project.

### discuss an example where you were able to motivate co-workers or employees.

I once found myself in a situation where my department management was being controlled by employees who had no
experience in our department, in a bid to optimize profits above service. A lot of my colleagues resisted the
spontaneous changes that took place, but when I identified a few benefits we stood to gain, I had to make a U-turn and
motivate my co-workers to give a new idea an opportunity to succeed.

===============================================================

We went through a merger at CorpX, Inc. last year that lowered morale for some teams. Our group had new management that
gave us responsibilities with which we had little experience. I noticed a dip in our overall productivity and felt I had
to do something to improve our perspective on the situation.

So I called a meeting and encouraged the team to embrace the learning opportunities and see this as career development.
We went around the room and listed one positive thing that came from this experience individually. The mood lifted after
that, and the positive energy translated into better productivity and engagement.

### Give me an example of a time you had a conflict with a team member. How did you handle it?

At CorpX Inc., my team was responsible for a project with a short deadline. I had one view of how it should be
accomplished, which seemed to have support within the team. However, one person disagreed and was causing tension as a
result. I knew for us to complete the project in time, I had to find a way to bring this person on board. So I took him
to lunch, talked with him one-on-one, and tried to understand his point of view.

I managed to find a compromise that we could take to the rest of the team. It was not exactly what he wanted, but he
said he would be OK with it. The team was agreeable, and we worked together to get the project done on time.

### Describe a time when you had to do something you weren't trained to do. How did you handle it?

I had been at CorpX Software as a PHP developer for four years when the company decided to switch over to using Python.
Most of my fellow developers had Python or related skills and could easily make the switch. I, however, had only ever
learned Go.

On reflection, I could have quit and looked for another job, but I liked working at CorpX and the people I worked with
were very supportive. Plus, CorpX was a small company and did not have the resources to offer training. So I proactively
enrolled in a Python course, bought some books, and before long, I was able to help our team convert our existing code
base to Python.

### What would you do if a manager asked you to perform a task you've never done before?

In my last role as a PHP developer, my manager asked me to build and launch a new Go app, which was something I'd never
done before. I explained to my manager that I had no experience leading that type of project but volunteered to do all
the work if someone more experienced could offer guidance. I met with several coworkers who had experience running Go
apps, studied best practices, and successfully launched the app. Thanks to that hands-on learning experience, I became
the team expert on Go.

### What would you do if you made a mistake no one noticed?

I've always found it's better to take responsibility for your mistakes than to learn from your errors. When I worked as
a junior PHP developer, a client asked for a fast fix in the project and I accidentally made a bug. While there's a
chance they may never have known, I knew my error could affect their experience. I promptly told my manager, remade the
task and apologized to the client for the wait. The client felt satisfied, and my manager thanked me for doing the right
thing. From that point forward, I paid special attention to fast fixes.

### Tell me about a time when you failed. How did you learn from this experience?

In my first month as a PHP developer, I wanted to impress a client and overpromised a project timeline. Unfortunately,
the team didn't have the resources to deliver by the deadline I'd promised, and we ended up losing the client. I reached
out to the client and took full responsibility for the loss, and they gave us another chance. Because of this
experience, I learned the value of setting realistic expectations and never guaranteeing more than I could deliver.

### What professional accomplishment are you most proud of and how did you achieve it?

In my previous work as an IT administrator, during my regular maintenance rounds, I found a security vulnerability.
Rather than simply patching it, I looked into the network records and discovered a virus had recently compromised
several files. I notified the rest of the team and we quickly isolated the infected files and prevented their spread,
which saved the company a lot of money. That experience ignited my passion for preventing cybercrime and drove me to
apply for this position as a cybersecurity manager.

### How do you accomplish tasks when under a tight deadline? Give me an example

Well, typically, I try to never commit to a deadline I don’t think I can make. But sometimes, unexpected things happen
and you’re forced to think on your feet. For example, at my last job, my coworker had to take some time off work because
of an emergency, and his project was left without a programmer.

My manager then instructed me to take over his project and complete what work was left. Suddenly, I had a new project on
my hands, and I wasn’t really sure how to handle it, as the deadline was in 1 week.

First, I requested a reduction on my own daily tasks goals - which I was granted. This way, I could pay more attention
to the project, and only a few hours per day to my original tasks. Once I had a consistent schedule and hours set for
each of my tasks, it was mostly easy from there.

Thanks to my teammates and my good time management skills, I managed to finish up 2 days early before the deadline. And
once my coworker came back to work, I was able to review the whole thing with him before submitting it. For what it’s
worth, he was thoroughly impressed. And a few months later, I even got promoted based on my performance.

### Why Do You Want to Work Here?

I've seen your portfolio, and it's really inspired me to apply! I love working with a team to achieve a common goal, and
I know my background in production has prepared me for this role. I look forward to becoming a valued contributor to
this phenomenal team.

I've seen your company consistently listed as one of the top places to work. I've read employee testimonials and heard
how you encourage employee growth through education, training, and vast resources. I would love to join your innovative
team, continue to create great work, and grow within the company by further improving my skills.

I know that you’re a leader in the industry, and I would be proud to work for a company with such an excellent track
record for innovation. I have a friend that works in the accounting department, and he told me that the culture here is
top-notch and that management supports continuing education and learning on the job while rewarding hard work. Based on
his assessment and encouragement, I think that I would fit in perfectly with the team here.

I specifically want to work here because I read your company’s mission and vision. After finding out more information
about your company from social media, I can clearly see how my goals align with that of the company. There's nothing I
love more than when I am working with other engaged individuals toward a common goal, and that's what excited me about
working here.

I first found your company several years ago, and I was inspired by the style of your brand. You market yourselves to a
wide audience, which I can relate to. After following you and observing your job openings for several years while
working my way up at a smaller marketing firm, I believe I am now ready to join your exceptional team, enhancing and
driving forward a brand that is a natural extension of my own values.

Before the recruiter called me about this opportunity, I must admit that I didn't know much about your company. I've
been doing some research in preparation for this discussion, and I need to say that I'm impressed by your work and your
vision for the future. I'm genuinely interested in getting more involved in the technological side of marketing, and I
read that you are growing in that area. As an experienced programmer with an emphasis on technology, I know I can bring
a lot of value to the team.

#### So, DON’T say you want to work a particular job for the following reasons:

- You like the hefty salary
- You’re in it for the benefits and perks
- You couldn’t land a job at another company so you’re settling
- You want to work remotely, no matter the job
- You’re desperate to get hired anywhere

### Why Should We Hire You?

I believe that my experience with technology, specifically in the programming space, makes me the best match for this
position. In my previous job, I was responsible for maintaining and updating our company website. This required keeping
employee profiles updated and continuously posting information regarding upcoming events. I truly enjoyed what I was
doing, which is what drew me to apply for this position. I would love to bring the coding skills I learned there to this
new and more challenging role.

### Tell me about a time you had to deal with a client that was asking the impossible.

Clients in the IT industry are very demanding in general, but one of them stands out when I look back. I was a
programmer at company CorpX at the time and I had a sales meeting with a prospective client. The client demands were
unrealistic, to say the least. They wanted us to do the complete rebranding in just two weeks. This included an updated
logo, new website, posters, AND a digital ad campaign. I didn’t want to turn down the client, but what he was asking for
was just not possible. So, I took my time and carefully explained to him what goes behind each step of the developing
process, and how long everything takes for us. I think it’s important for clients to know the value of the work they are
getting. After our talk, the client seemed to be more understanding and decided to give us 20 days instead of 2 weeks.
That’s still a pretty tight deadline, but we made it work. While the work wasn’t easy, we managed to establish a
reasonable flow of work with the client for future projects.

### Tell me about a time when you successfully delegated tasks to your team.

`Situation`: Well, at my first job as a team lead, I had to really get to know most of my team in order to delegate
tasks appropriately.

`Task`: Most team members were new to the company, so I didn’t have much to go with.

`Action`: So, I sat down with each team member individually, and really got to know them and their strengths and
weaknesses, and distributed tasks based on their personality.

`Results`: Team members were pretty happy with the tasks they got, and started off their relationship with our company
on a positive note.

### Tell me about your first job in the industry. What did you do to learn the ropes?

`Situation`: Well, my first job in the field was as a junior PHP programmer. While I did have extensive knowledge of the
field, I didn’t have too much experience doing it.

`Task`: This made it very hard for me to get started with the job. While I was working almost all the time, I wasn’t
getting too much done.

`Action`: So, what I did was, taking a lot of my personal time to really work and learn the ins and outs of programming.
I also made sure to talk to my team members and get their input on daily tasks.

`Results`: A few months into the job, I managed to learn the ropes and ended up being a lot more productive.

### Can you give me an example of when you had to adapt to a new and sudden change in the workplace? What happened?

`Situation`: Sure thing. In my previous position as an programmer at Company CorpX, we had to suddenly change all of our
CRM software and move all the data to a new tool. The CRM tool we’d been using till now wasn’t fit for a growing team,
and on top of that, they were upping their pricing, so it wasn’t really worthwhile for us.

`Task`: I was put in charge of finding the replacement CRM, as I was the one who knew the previous one inside-out. And
this was also an opportunity for me to clean up our outdated info and start fresh. All the while, I still had to handle
my daily responsibilities and as usual.

`Action`: So, the first thing I did was ask our sales associates and lead generation teams what they thought of the old
CRM, and if there were any new features they were lacking. After doing a bit of research and asking around, I found the
perfect tool that had it all - sales analytics, email integration, and more. And because I typically have no problem
with learning new tools, I stayed in one evening, transferred our data to the new tool, and wiped the old account.
Finally, I sent a new announcement to the entire team about the new software, as well as a video on how to use it.

`Results`: We completed the transfer with 4 days to spare, the team was satisfied with the new CRM, and my daily
responsibilities as an programmer didn’t suffer.

### Describe a long-term project you managed. How did you make sure everything was running smoothly?

`Situation`: When I was at Company CorpX, I was managing the web development team in charge of setting up a new website
for one of our biggest clients at the time. With most projects, we had a process set up and we would get most sites done
in up to 2 months. This project, however, was a bit different, as the website was supposed to be more detailed, with a
lot of unique pages. So, we had to be a lot more careful with our time-management.

`Task`: We had a strict deadline of 15 weeks, and I had to make sure that we used up our time as efficiently as
possible.

`Action`: Before getting to actual work, I decided that we should plan everything out by the week. After some research
and consulting with our team of developers, we decided to split the workload between different stages. We would devote
around 1 week to the discovery phase, 5 weeks to design, 3 weeks to initial development and the rest to any
modifications and updates.

`Results`: In the end, we actually finished the website with all the promised functionalities in just under 3 months.
The client was very satisfied with the result and eventually ended up recommending partners to our firm.

### Tell me about a time you set a personal goal for yourself. How did you ensure you would meet your objectives and what steps did you take?

`Situation`: I think the most recent, and important, personal goal that comes to mind is that I managed to teach myself
web development from scratch. You see, I wasn’t very satisfied as an engineer at Heavy Machinery's Plant. My coworkers were nice, and
the pay was decent too, but I just didn’t see myself growing there.

`Task`: So, I decided that I wanted a career change in a field I’ve always been interested in - web development. Now,
because I was working full-time, I had to be very efficient with my time-management skills.

`Action`: I did some research, and all that was left to do was just follow my routine and stay committed. I set up a
personal calendar and made sure to study HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for at least 2 hours every day. I gathered a list of
beginner-friendly books to start with, and once I was done with those, I paid for some advanced online courses to
improve my HTML and PHP skills. When I felt comfortable, I started working on some personal projects for my
portfolio and did some freelance work part-time while I was still working at Plant.

`Results`: In the end, I’m glad I stuck to my plan and continued with my set curriculum. If I did not have my calendar
planned out with specific objectives, I surely would have been overwhelmed. Sure, at times, it felt like I was basically
working 2 jobs and that a lot of the material wasn’t making sense. But I just kept moving forward, and then, I got my
first real break as a junior web dev at Company CorpY.


### Have you ever had to work under someone who wasn’t very good at communicating? What happened?

`Situation`: Yes, at my last job as a tech recruiter the hiring manager I was working directly with was somewhat more
difficult to communicate with. He had very strict and precise requirements on the type of candidates he wanted to invite
for interviews. He wasn’t open to much communication on the matter or trying new things even when the company
desperately needed new hires. This one time, I got a candidate that was a pretty good fit for the job, but was lacking
in some aspects.

`Task`: I wanted to make sure that we got the person in for an interview, but I was 100% sure that my hiring manager would
shut me down.

`Action`: So, before running the candidate through him, I called them and collected his biggest strengths to present to
the hiring manager.

`Results`: The hiring manager did, indeed, end up liking the candidate and calling them in for an interview.

### Tell me about a time when you successfully explained a technical problem to a colleague or a customer who didn’t have a tech background?

`Situation`: I’ve worked as a tech support specialist before, so I really excel at this. I’ve had to explain complex
concepts to customers on a regular basis, but to give you one single example, I’ve had to explain to clients with next
to no understanding of computers how to delete a virus on their computer.

`Task`: After trying to give basic instructions to the client, they still didn’t really understand much, so I had to come
up with a smarter solution.

`Action`: So what I did was, I walked them through the entire thing step by step while explaining it simply but in no
condescending terms. Instead of making them do most of the work, I walked them through the process of getting me to
connect with their computer, and then I explained to them what, exactly, I did.

`Results`: The customer was very happy with my work, and we managed to fix the issue with their computer.

### Tell me about a time when you had to work with someone completely different from you. How did you adapt to collaborate better?

`Situation`: Sure, I always enjoy working with new and different people. Usually, because they bring something new to the
table. At Company CorpX, there was a particularly young developer who was assigned to work with me on a new software
development project, and I was to run him through what our typical coding process was like.

`Task`: It was also my job to get to know him, and find common ground so that we could effectively work together. The fact
that he was younger wasn’t an issue for me, but because he was completely self-taught, he didn’t know a lot about the
industry methodologies we used.

`Action`: Teaching him everything from scratch would take too much time. So, instead, I briefly explained the development
process (waterfall model) we were using for that specific project, and taught him how to write tests for our code-base.
Writing tests is the number 1 way to learn what code does. After all, that’s how I got started with development.

`Results`: I also sat down and helped him go through the material at times, but in the end, he surprised me by how much of
a fast-learner he was. He just needed a bit of encouragement and guidance. Through this approach, he learned our whole
routine in less than a week, while most of our new hires needed at least up to 2 weeks. In return, I learned a lot about
multitasking and time-management from him. The whole thing was a win-win situation, and it was all smooth sailing the
next time we worked together (which was quite often).

### What do you do when your team member refuses to, or just can’t complete their part of the work? Give me an example.

`Situation`: There was one co-worker at Company X who was notorious for being bad at deadlines. But she would always end
up delivering exceptional work, just a few hours (or worse - days) late. For some reason, the company was ok with this
as her work was just too good. So, this one time, the management put us together to work on a time-sensitive project.

`Task`: Our task was to turn in a sales presentation together and have our manager go over it before sending the client
the final version. Because of how important the project was, I didn’t want to risk going over the deadline - as this
would also directly impact other people. Either way, for everyone’s sake, I had to somehow get her to hurry up with the
project. So, I decided to try and push her a little and see what would happen.

`Action`: I started regularly checking in on her to see where she was with work. I would bring it up at times over lunch,
send a quick Slack message, and so on. She wasn’t taking this quite well, but it DID get her to work faster and more
efficiently.

`Results`: At the end, the constant check-ins and pushing did have a positive effect, even though the co-worker didn’t
particularly like me too much once we were finished with the work. We even managed to submit the final version of the
presentation 2 days before the deadline.


### Clients can be difficult to work with sometimes. Can you describe a situation when a client was wrong and you had to correct them?

`Situation`: Absolutely. One of our past clients at Agency CorpX came to us because his Facebook advertising strategy wasn’t
working. He was driving traffic but wasn’t getting any conversions, so they thought that it was because they weren’t
reaching the right audience. We realized, though, that it was actually because their product homepage wasn’t really that
convincing. The client, however, was adamant about “not fixing what wasn’t broken.”

`Task`: I had to somehow communicate with the client that the service he wanted wasn’t what he wanted - there was no way
for us to fix his Facebook ads if his homepage wasn’t selling the product.

`Action`: We had to give the client an ultimatum - they either go with our approach, or we wouldn’t be able to get the
results (and hence, work with them).

`Results`: After some back and forth, the client grudgingly agreed to do an A/B test between the existing landing page,
and one that we’d propose. So, we tested the two landing pages with the same ads he’d been running, and ended up getting
2.5x better results. From then on, the client was a lot more willing to allow us to experiment with whatever we
proposed.
